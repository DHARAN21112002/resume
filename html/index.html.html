    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> <strong> Hi, Iâ€™m Vidhyadharan Selvaraj </strong>  â€“ a digitally driven marketing professional with a passion for blending strategy, creativity, and technology to build impactful brand experiences. Iâ€™ve recently completed my MSc in Digital Marketing at Ravensbourne University London, following a Bachelorâ€™s in Commerce with Computer Applications, where I developed a strong foundation in e-commerce, virtual marketing, and business operations.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve worked on live marketing projects that explored customer behavior both online and offline, and developed data informed strategies to improve visibility, engagement, and conversion. These experiences helped me build practical skills in digital campaign planning, content creation, performance tracking, and audience targeting.

Iâ€™m proficient with tools like Canva, Excel, Google Analytics, and major social media platforms, and I enjoy crafting thoughtful campaigns that combine creativity with measurable results.

Now, Iâ€™m seeking a full-time role where I can contribute to digital strategy, performance marketing, or business operations within a forward-thinking, tech enabled environment. I bring a mindset thatâ€™s proactive, analytical, and user-focused and Iâ€™m ready to grow, learn, and deliver value from day one.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s ready to turn ideas into results. </p>
